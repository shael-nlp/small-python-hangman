# small-python-hangman
This is a small python hangman I did for my early python classes:
- to be executed in a console environment
- interface is in french
- but works with french and english lexicons
- A french lexicon "lexique.txt" is provided by default

You may edit line 8 to include your own lexicon file path instead.
Also, you may edit lines 9 and 10 to change the settings to your liking.
