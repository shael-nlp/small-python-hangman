# small-python-hangman
This is a small python hangman I did for my early python classes:
- to be executed in a console environment
- interface is in french
- works with french and english lexicons
- A french lexicon "lexique.txt" is provided by default

## instructions
- have python installed
- run "run.bat"

You may edit lines 8, 9, 10 in "main.py" if you want to change the rules or use your own lexicon.
